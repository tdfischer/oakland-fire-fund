This project is overseen by Max Allstadt, one of four co-founders of The Totally Intense Fractal Mindgaze Hut, An Oakland DIY venue and co-living space that operated from 2006-2015. Advice and consulting from volunteers with decades of experience in construction, architecture, zoning and fire safety. 

Those involved in this project have made personal donations to relief funds for the friends we lost in the Ghost Ship fire. This project exists because there is also a need to take steps to protect arts spaces from risk and displacement in the years to come.

Fiscal Sponsorship by the The California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund 501c3
