<p>This fund accepts tax deductible donations which will be used exclusively to pay for confidential fire safety consultations and fire safety equipment upgrades in DIY warehouse spaces, galleries an venues. 

<p>100% of donations will pay for materials, equipment, and consulting fees to professionals with demonstrated expertise in fire safety. Architects and other construction professionals have offered both limited volunteer time and reduced rates, and anyone we work with will be vetted to assure they will keep what they see at any space we send them to completely confidential.

<p>We don’t have a lot of money right now, so we will likely have to prioritize providing important but not costly items such as exit signs, fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and emergency wayfinding lighting. The more we raise, the more we can expand our scope. In an ideal world we could pay for substantial renovations in spaces that have long term leases, but we’re not there yet.

<p>If you need help making your DIY space safer, please contact us. Our process will be to first pay for a consultant to visit your space and make recommendations, after which we will provide materials for improvements as best as we can with the budget we’re working with. 

<p>Most DIY art spaces are already very safe. Part of our goal is to help them fix any issues that might lead to problems with government officials, before the officials show up. We want to make these spaces both as physically safe as possible and as safe as they can be from displacement.

<p>If you need an expert to evaluate your space or if you have questions about this fund, contact us: oaklandartistsfiresafetyfund@gmail.com <mailto:oaklandartistsfiresafetyfund@gmail.com>
